# Supabase MCP Server Development Plan

This document outlines the development plan for the Supabase MCP Server. The project is divided into several phases to ensure a structured and robust development process.

## Phase 1: Initial Implementation (Completed)

The first phase involved setting up the core infrastructure of the MCP server.

-   **[x] Project Setup:** Created the `supabase_mcp_server` directory and basic project structure.
-   **[x] FastMCP Server:** Initialized a `FastMCP` server with a Stdio transport layer.
-   **[x] Supabase Client:** Integrated the `supabase-py` client, managed through a server lifespan context to handle connections.
-   **[x] Environment Configuration:** Set up credential management using a `.env` file for the Supabase URL and service key.
-   **[x] Basic CRUD Tools:** Implemented the four fundamental tools for database interaction:
    -   `create_records`
    -   `read_rows` (with basic "equals" filtering)
    -   `update_records`
    -   `delete_records`
-   **[x] Initial Documentation:** Created `README.md` with setup and usage instructions and a `TASKS.md` for tracking work.

## Phase 2: Enhancements and Robustness

This phase focuses on making the server more powerful, reliable, and maintainable.

-   **[ ] Robust Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for all Supabase operations. This will involve catching potential exceptions (e.g., network errors, invalid table/column names, failed queries) and returning clear, informative error messages to the LLM.
-   **[ ] Advanced Filtering:** Enhance the `read_rows`, `update_records`, and `delete_records` tools to support a wider range of query operators beyond simple equality. This will include:
    -   `neq` (not equal)
    -   `gt` (greater than)
    -   `lt` (less than)
    -   `gte` (greater than or equal to)
    -   `lte` (less than or equal to)
    -   `like` (pattern matching)
    -   `in` (value is in a list)
-   **[ ] Code Refactoring:** Improve the structure of the tool implementations to reduce code duplication, particularly in how filters are applied across different functions.

## Phase 3: Testing and Validation

To ensure the server functions correctly and reliably, a comprehensive testing suite will be developed.

-   **[ ] Unit Tests:** Create unit tests for each tool. This will involve mocking the Supabase client to isolate the tool's logic and test its behavior without making actual database calls.
-   **[ ] Test Framework:** Use `pytest` as the testing framework.
-   **[ ] Test Coverage:** Aim for high test coverage for all the business logic within the server tools.

## Phase 4: Finalization

The final phase involves polishing the documentation and preparing the server for broader use.

-   **[ ] Documentation Review:** Update the `README.md` and in-code docstrings to reflect all new features and enhancements.
-   **[ ] Task Completion:** Mark all items in `TASKS.md` as complete.
